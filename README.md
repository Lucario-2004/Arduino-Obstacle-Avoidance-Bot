# Arduino-Obstacle-Avoidance-Bot
This Arduino Uno-based bot uses an ultrasonic sensor (NewPing) for distance measurement (200 cm max). It has 4 DC motors controlled via AFMotor Shield, and a servo motor to scan left &amp; right. The bot detects obstacles, moves forward or turns 🏁, ensuring autonomous navigation 🚀.


🛠️ Components Overview
🌍 Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04 / NewPing Library)
- Measures distance to obstacles using ultrasound waves 📡.
- Range: 2 cm to 200 cm, with precise readings 👀.
- Helps the robot decide when to stop or turn based on obstacle detection.
⚙️ Servo Motor (SG90)
- Rotates the ultrasonic sensor left and right to scan surroundings 🔄.
- Uses the Servo library for positioning.
- Ensures better obstacle detection by widening the sensing area.
🚗 DC Motors (4-Wheel Drive)
- Controlled via AFMotor Shield for movement 🏁.
- Two forward motors & two backward motors enable quick turns.
- Speed controlled dynamically to avoid sudden stops 🏎️.
🛠️ Microcontroller: Arduino Uno
- The brain of the bot, executing sensor readings & movement commands 📟.
- Interfaces with motor shield, ultrasonic sensor, and servo.
- Supports real-time obstacle avoidance logic for smooth navigation 🔄.


📚 Libraries Used
- AFMotor.h – Controls the motor driver shield.
- NewPing.h – Handles ultrasonic distance measurements.
- Servo.h – Controls servo movement for scanning obstacles.


🔄 Step-by-Step Approach
🏗️ Step 1: Hardware Setup
🔧 Connect Motors – Link all DC motors via AFMotor Shield for smooth driving.
📡 Attach Ultrasonic Sensor – Wire trig & echo pins to Arduino A0 & A1.
🔗 Fix Servo Motor – Mount HC-SR04 on the servo for lateral scanning 🔄.
🖥️ Step 2: Software Configuration
📜 Include Libraries – Import AFMotor, NewPing, Servo for control.
🛠️ Set Pin Assignments – Define sensor pins, motor control, and servo angles.
🚀 Initialize Components – Start ultrasonic scanning & motor activation.
📡 Step 3: Obstacle Detection & Navigation
👀 Read Distance – Measure proximity to obstacles using NewPing.ping_cm().
🚦 Decision Making – If distance ≤ 40 cm, bot stops & scans left/right.
🔄 Turn Toward Open Path – Moves left/right based on detected space.
🏁 Step 4: Movement Execution
🚗 Move Forward – Robot continues straight if the path is clear 🛣️.
⏪ Move Backward – Steps back if an obstacle is too close.
🔄 Turn Left/Right – Uses servo scanning to select the best turn direction.
🔍 Step 5: Optimization & Testing
🧪 Calibrate Distance Range – Adjust sensor sensitivity for accuracy 📡.
⚡ Speed Control – Implement gradual speed increases for smooth navigation.
🤖 Enhance AI Logic – Introduce path planning or machine learning for smarter movement 🚀.


🚀 Final Thoughts
This Arduino-based Obstacle Avoidance Robot autonomously navigates using ultrasonic sensors, ensuring collision-free movement 🚗. With future enhancements like IoT integration, camera vision, or AI-based path optimization, it can be adapted for delivery bots, smart mobility, or industrial automation 🏭.
